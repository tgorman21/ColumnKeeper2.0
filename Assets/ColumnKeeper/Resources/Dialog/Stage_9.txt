Humphry:"Do you hear that?"
Humphry:"It's the sound of beating drums...war drums!"
Humphry:"Look out there; a large goblin is carried on a litter."
Humphry:"He must be the one in charge; if we beat him, we can save the princess!"
Derzin:"Hear me, humans! I, Derzin, King of the Goblins, have stolen your wonderful princess."
Derzin:"You want her back in one piece, yes? Then submit to me."
Derzin:"Fold your kingdom under my banners, and together we will secure the entire continent."
Derzin:"We will become powerful enough to rival even Demon Lord Sol'gan, and I Derzin will take my rightful place as king of everything. Kekeke"
Humphry:"The hero won't be swayed by your candied words Derzin!"
Humphry:"We only bow to King Harrison and the three Gods."
Humphry:"Prepare yourself; we will rescue Princess Maple from your grubby green hands!"

Derzin:"Kekeke...you're too late, humans."
Derzin:"You may have beaten me...but I've already given your precious princess to General Zarzog!"
Derzin:"She's probably being probed for information as we speak."
Derzin:"General Zarzog will crush this kingdom and give the Goblins the home they deserve."
Humphry:"We were too late...but we aren't done yet!"
Humphry:"We can still defeat this General Zarzog and bring the princess home!"
Humphry:"We have to muster ourselves, dear hero, I thought this creature was the mastermind, but it must be that Demon Lord Sol'gan."
Humphry:"Let's press on…to save the princess and the kingdom!"
