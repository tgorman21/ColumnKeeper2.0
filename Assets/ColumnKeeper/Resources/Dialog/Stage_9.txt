"Do you hear that?"
"It's the sound of beating drums...war drums!"
"Look out there; a large goblin is carried on a litter."
"He must be the one in charge; if we beat him, we can save the princess!"
"Hear me, humans! I, Derzin, King of the Goblins, have stolen your wonderful princess."
"You want her back in one piece, yes? Then submit to me."
"Fold your kingdom under my banners, and together we will secure the entire continent."
"We will become powerful enough to rival even Demon Lord Sol'gan, and I Derzin will take my rightful place as king of everything. Kekeke"
"The hero won't be swayed by your candied words Derzin!"
"We only bow to King Harrison and the three Gods."
"Prepare yourself; we will rescue Princess Maple from your grubby green hands!"

"Kekeke...you're too late, humans."
"You may have beaten me...but I've already given your precious princess to General Zarzog!"
"She's probably being probed for information as we speak."
"General Zarzog will crush this kingdom and give the Goblins the home they deserve."
"We were too late...but we aren't done yet!"
"We can still defeat this General Zarzog and bring the princess home!"
"We have to muster ourselves, dear hero, I thought this creature was the mastermind, but it must be that Demon Lord Sol'gan."
"Let's press on…to save the princess and the kingdom!"
