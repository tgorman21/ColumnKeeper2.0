Humphry:"It's the sound of beating drums...war drums!"-10
Humphry:"Look out there; a large goblin is carried on a litter."-10
Humphry:"He must be the one in charge; if we beat him, we can save the princess!"-10
Derzin:"Hear me, humans! I, Derzin, King of the Goblins, have stolen your wonderful princess."-10
Derzin:"You want her back in one piece, yes? Then submit to me."-10
Derzin:"Fold your kingdom under my banners, and together we will secure the entire continent."-10
Derzin:"We will become powerful enough to rival even Demon Lord Sol'gan, and I Derzin will take my rightful place as king of everything. Kekeke"-10
Humphry:"The hero won't be swayed by your candied words Derzin!"-10
Humphry:"We only bow to King Harrison and the three Gods."-10

Derzin:"Kekeke...you're too late, humans."-10
Derzin:"You may have beaten me...but I've already given your precious princess to General Zarzog!"-10
Derzin:"She's probably being probed for information as we speak."-10
Derzin:"General Zarzog will crush this kingdom and give the Goblins the home they deserve."-10
Humphry:"We were too late...but we aren't done yet!"-10
Humphry:"We can still defeat this General Zarzog and bring the princess home!"-10
Humphry:"We have to muster ourselves, dear hero, I thought this creature was the mastermind, but it must be that Demon Lord Sol'gan."-10
Humphry:"Let's press on…to save the princess and the kingdom!"-10
